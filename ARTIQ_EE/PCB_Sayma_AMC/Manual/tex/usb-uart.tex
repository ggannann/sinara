\section{USB-UART}
\subsection{UART Switch}

UART from FPGA is connected through Multiplexer (SN74CB3T3257PW). Selection between MMC and USB is preformes automaticly. When micro-USB is connected S siglnal is high and Multiplexer connects USB to FPGA.\\ 

\subsection{USB-UART bridge}

The USB-UART bridge (FT4232H) requires USB device drivers, vailable free from http://www.ftdichip.com,
which are used to make the FT4232H on the Mini Module appear as a four virtual COM ports (VCP). This
then allows the user to communicate with the USB interface via a standard PC serial emulation port
(TTY).\\ Another FTDI USB driver, the D2XX driver, can also be used with application software to directly
access the FT4232H on the Mini Module though a DLL. \\
